*Cloud-native engineering leader with a focus on reliability, scalability, and security for the modern web.*

## **CTO Profile**

I am an engineering manager passionate about building features across the full stack. I have found a particular interest in working at startups and growing their offerings with maintainability and scale in mind while balancing a user-oriented mindset.

I began my career working as a deck officer in 2009. In 2012 I joined a ship management company as a training and development professional, and this stage of my career helped me focus on digitization. In 2014 I took a startup job and had been employed full-time ever since. I have individual contributor experience as well as considerable team-lead experience. As someone self-taught, I benefited from working closely with other engineers to learn and grow, and as I continue to do that, I have also developed a special passion for helping others grow.

I care about developing reliable and maintainable software. I aim to write code that is so readable that it looks boring. "Code golf" isn't my sport. I rely on community-trusted libraries to increase productivity and keep my teams from maintaining software that's not core to our business needs.
